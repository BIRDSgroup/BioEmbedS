# Identifying cross-tissue signaling between genes from biomedical literature

This is the official repository of the paper "Identifying gene mediators of cross-tissuesignaling from biomedical literature usingbalanced word embeddings"  


## Installation

See ```requirements.txt``` file for the list of dependencies. Setup everything by executing  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

## Running

1. Navigate to either BioEmbedS or BioEmbedS-TS  
2. Run all the BioEmbedS_fold[i].py files where [i] is the fold, numbered 0 to 4. 

## Results

Results are available at the project webpage https://cross-tissue-signaling.herokuapp.com/
